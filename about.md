# About the Author  

Hi my name is Adi, I am an aspiring electrical engineer in his final year at the University of Queensland.
I'm not sure quite what else to put about myself, I guess I like football (soccer for the uneducated) 
and am an occasional gamer.

I decided to take ELEC4630 in the hopes of future proofing my skillset considering that Machine Learning
seems to be the future of all tech. I am finding the course quite difficult but lets see how we go, still got 
many chances to do well

Thank you and hope you enjoyed the blog.
