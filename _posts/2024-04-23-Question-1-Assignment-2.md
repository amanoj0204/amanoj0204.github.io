#GUI - Funny sounding word  

Today involved attempting to make a GUI for a fingerprint recognition system. What I 
found difficult with this task is that the tutorials and lectures did not run through 
how to make a GUI. I have never made a GUI in my life and this task took a lot of learning
but I finally did it. It looks a little bit bland but considering the amount of time I put towards it, I am okay with that

Currently as of 9:22pm on the 22nd of April (Tuesday), the issue im facing is integrating the fingerprint code
given by my course coordinator into the GUI. There seems to be a host of errors with the fingerprint database 
I am using and the dimensionality of the expected images in the fingerprint analysis code.

Not sure how to fix it as of right now, but I can barely keep my eyes open. 

##Time to go to bed
