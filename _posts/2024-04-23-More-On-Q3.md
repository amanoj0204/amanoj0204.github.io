## GPU >>>> CPU

I think the blog title is the best summary I can give of the speed difference between the GPU and the CPU. From my calcultions
which were presented in my report, it seems that the GPU was approximately 11.2 times faster than the CPU.

Funny thing that happened, when I was doing this exercise with the CPU i was using my personal computer in the university
library. Once the processing begun, the fans started roaring like an airline jet engine and i got alot of weird looks.

It suffices to say that i'll be using a GPU based approach for all my Deep Learning needs from now on (not sure if I have any though)

Here is a handy table summarising the difference between the two:

Here is the output when I run the NVTOP command on the terminal. The image I'm showing you is from then I had the largest batch size.
It took a lot of memory from the GPU, showing how intensive the Deep Learning tasks are:
