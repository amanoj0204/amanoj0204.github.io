# Lets talk about Assignment 1 

## What happened?
Assignment 1 was an unmitigated disaster on my end. I did not quite understand what the meaning was behind doing the report.
In my head, this was effectively just a coding subject and a coding assignment where I write some code and have it analysed
by tutors. I did not realise (completely my own fault) that I had to do more in terms of explaining my methods, what went 
wrong, what went write and how i could improve.

And it was a big shock when I got my marks back and I'll be honest when I say that I nearly had a heart attack.

Not to worry , because here we are at the start of Assignment 2. Things can only get better right.....?

Lets find out.
