#Quantum Mechanics? To be or not to be

So Ive just attempted Question 5. The youtube video by Qiskit explaining the experiment was quite informative.
My understanding was that as far as we can tell, Quantum mechanics and classical mechanics dont obey the same laws 
and as of our current understanding of the world cant work together to explain the universe.

the CHSH inequality, which my computer is currently processing explains gives us an outcome averaging 2.8, with binary 
inputs. With classical mechanics, we expect and outcome averaging less than or equal to two. Since we know that nothing
not even information can travel at the speed of light, it must be something else?

Thats to do with probablistic values rather than definetive. Its hard to wrap my head around how something can be SOME PROBABILITY 
OF ONE NUMBER OR SOME PROBABILITY OF ANOTHER. That makes no sense buts thats what the 2022 Nobel prize winners demonstrated.

As a future electrical engineer, Im glad I wont be doing quantum mechanics:D
